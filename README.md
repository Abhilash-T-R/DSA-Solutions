# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Solutions

A collection of my solutions to various DSA problems, covering topics from arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more. These solutions are optimized and well-documented to help others understand the thought process behind each implementation.

## Introduction
This repository contains my personal solutions to DSA problems that I have solved. Each problem has a detailed explanation of the approach, the code, and the time/space complexity.

## Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Searching and Sorting
- Recursion

## How to Use
Each folder corresponds to a particular topic (e.g., Arrays, Linked Lists). Inside each folder, you will find individual solutions to specific problems, with detailed explanations and code.

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DSA-Solutions`
- Navigate to the specific problem directory
- Each solution will have a `.md` file with the explanation and a `.cpp` file with the code.
